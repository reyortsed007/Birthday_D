  <p class="message fade delay">
It’s one of those days that comes only once a year in everyone’s life… and now it’s your turn, my dear.
Today is the day when the love of my life was born. And God, to make sure that you always stay happy, made me after you.
Yes, I am younger than you, and yet we have fallen for each other. This is one of the most precious moments of my life — a moment where I can appreciate you more than ever before.
I may not offer you the whole world, my love, but I can give you my devotion and a love that will never die.
Happy Birthday, Deepti — meri jaaneman, meri saathi, meri rab, meri chand.
Wishing you the happiest birthday, my love. 💕
